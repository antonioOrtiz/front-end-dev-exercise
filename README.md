For this exercise, you will be creating a simple form and handling the validation and submission via Javascript. The components of the assignment are:

1. Use the artwork found in the "artwork" folder for direction on colors, fonts, layout, etc.
2. Develop an HTML form that follows the design direction provided utilizing a responsive layout
  * Use your intuition on how to handle the responsive aspects of the design
  * In the "css" folder there is a file called "fonts.css" that has references to all the fonts needed to implement the design
3. Use Javascript to handle form validation with the following business rules:
  * First Name, Last Name, and Email are all required
  * Email address field must match a simple pattern for email addresses, including requiring a "@" and "."
4. Develop a front-end view to inform the user of any errors
